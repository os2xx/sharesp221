* Create a directory (folder) with "your account" as its name.
* Create a sub-directory "ATTENDANCE/" inside the folder above.
* Starting Week 01, create an empty file inside "ATTENDANCE/":
  * For Week 01, the file name in "W01.txt"
  * For the following weeks, the consecutive filenames will be "W02.txt", "W03.txt", and soon.
* This is the way!
